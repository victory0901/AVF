			<h2>Week 3 Discussion</h2>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">
				<h4>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h4>
				<p>Games, Social and Entertainment are the top selling categories in the US.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h4>
				<p>Games, Utilities and Entertainment are the top selling categories in the Japan.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h4>
				<p>Games, Utilities and Entertainment are the top selling categories in the Great Britain.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h4>
				<p>Games and Entertainment across the three markets are the top selling apps. People look to their phones for fun and entertainment more so than for business when it comes to apps they download.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>What percentage of Android users have the latest OS in U.S? Japan? Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h4>
				<p>Ice Cream Sandwich accounts for 10.9% Android devices. Still there are 64% of Android devices are still running Gingerbread. With this fragmentation, developers always have to make sure their apps are compatible with Gingerbread in order to reach the broadest market.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">
				<h4>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</h4>
				<p>Averages monthly cost are as follows: $36.00 for US, $49.00 for Japan and $33.00 Great Britain. Bandwidth limits: 100GB-250GB in US, 500GB-1TB, and unknown for Great Britain. You can see how the US can fall behind in technology due to caps and the limited broadband resources. You may get charged more in Japan but you are getting more bang for your buck. This would allow for Japanese developers to have more freedom in app size and testing of their app.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">
				<h4>What would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h4>
				<p>My first choice would be US because of familiarity. I believe I understand the US market better and the top selling app categories fall more in place with my preferences. Second choice would be Japan since they are ahead of US and UK from a technology standpoint. I think that market would also allow for the most flexibility in app creation.</p>
