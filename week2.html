			<h2>Week 2 Discussion</h2>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">
				<h4>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</h4>
				<p>One way would be to make sure that I use HTML 5 video instead of flash based video for improved accessibility. Also make sure to use the proper tags for various elements so that a screen reader would be able properly scan the page.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>What are some of the common frustrations with a "Mobile Screen Reader" and how could you fix them?</h4>
				<p>One of the main issues I saw discussed are that fact that most mobile devices nowadays no longer have physical keyboards. It is a lot harder for the visual impaired to navigate with a graphical keyboard versus a physical keyboard. One thing you can try to make up for the lack of physical keyboards is to put an emphasis on voice commands. It does not completely solve the issue but I believe it is the best option at this point.</p>

			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h4>
				<p><b>Braille Wave music system remote</b> is used with the Bose Wave Music system provides a braille overlay on the buttons of the remote. Also the buttons are a good size and provide a visual representation of the its functionality. <b>Sonic Boom Alarm Clock</b> is an alarm clock geared toward the hearing impaired. It comes with a bed shaker that rumbles when the alarm goes off. Also has an alarm that can get as loud as 113db.</p>
			</ul>
			<ul data-role="collapsible" data-theme="d">	
				<h4>Please list two apps that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h4>
				<p><b>LookTel Money Reader</b> is an iOS app for the visually impaired that uses the camera to identify the type of bill and speaks it back to you. <b>SayText</b> is an iOS app for the visually impaired that is able to scan text with the camera and read it back to you.</p>
